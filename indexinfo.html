			<h2>What is the principle?</h2>
			<p> Have you ever felt too tired to go buy groceries after a long day at work even though you really needed some? At this time did you wish you could have someone to do your grocery shopping, just the way you want it done and bring it to your door? This is what Home Shopping is for! </p>
		</div>

		<div class="card-info">
			<h2>How does it work?</h2>
			<p> We put you in contact with one of our shoppers who is in your area. The shoppers are people looking to make a little bit of extra money or who have a passion for shopping. You can pay them directly through our website once both of you uploaded a picture of the receipt for a more secure and transparent payment. The price is 10â‚¬ + 10% of the shopping total price.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="card-info">
			<h2>How can I trust that the shoppers will buy what I want?</h2>
			<p>We give you an opportunity to give feedback on the shoppers through our website. The shoppers can also give feedback on the clients. This way we can keep track of the satisfaction of both parties and make sure every shopper and every client are serious and respect their side of the deal.</p>
